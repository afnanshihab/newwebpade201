      <h2>How to Live a Healthy Lifestyle?</h2>>
      <p>It’s essential to negate a sedentary work life whenever you can. If something’s within walking distance, make the effort to travel by foot instead of by car. When you have time to spare, park farther than you normally would to increase your step count.</p>
      <h3>What are the 3 keys to a healthy lifestyle?</h3>
      <p>1. Nutrition.   2. Movement.    3. Caring for the spirit</p>
      <h4>How do I start living a healthy lifestyle?</h4>
      <p>Identify the bad or unhealthy habits in your life that you want to change. Then, for each habit come up with the reason you want to change. Maybe it’s for your own mental wellbeing or so you can play with your grandkids.</p>
      <h5>How do you maintain good mental health?</h5>
      <p>The ability to manage your feelings and deal with everyday stresses and difficulties can be challenging. Maintaining good mental health means occasionally putting your own needs first. We can’t take care of others if we don’t take care of our own mind and body.</p>
